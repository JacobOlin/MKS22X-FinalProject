# MKS22X-FinalProject

Dev Log:

5/20/19:
  Jacob- Started to work on allowing the player to move around. Also added a cool down on move so            that the player doesn't move too quickly. Also created the class walls. They show up but don't do anything.
  
5/21/19:
  Jacob- Created the interface fightable so that we can later loop through a list of fightables and have each one attack. Also created a pseudo-attack for the hero based on the direction they were last moving. It only creates a red space but it's in the direction that is most logical.
  
5/22/19:
  Jacob- Worked on the map so that the player can now enter different rooms. Each room can have a different amount of walls in various places. Also did a quality of life update by making the player move more smoothly.
  
5/23/19:
  Jacob- Today I basically worked on creating the entire map. You can now smoothly move to any part of the map and the walls prevent you from doing anything you wouldn't normally be able to do.
  
5/24/19:
  Jacob- Started working on making the Movable walls for the two locations in the map where you can actually push walls. The walls are giving me a bit of trouble but you can get the wall to move, it just doesn't look like it has moved.
  
5/28/19:
  Jacob- Today I got the movable walls to sort of work. You can push them but their movement is very clunky and they can be pushed into other walls.
  
5/29/19:
  Jacob- I got the movable walls to work a lot nicer. They move really smoothly, they can no longer be pushed into other walls, and will act like regular walls when they're pushed up against other walls. The movable walls also reset when you exit and re-enter the room.
